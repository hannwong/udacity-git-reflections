# Reflection 1

## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate with other people on my project.

Having the "_origin_" Git repo online where all my team members can access it allows all team
members to pull (download) each other's changes.

# Reflection 2

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In cases where the remote branch has some new commits added, doing a pull will probably merge those
changes into my local branch! That doesn't make me lose any local commits, but it is still annoying
to have my branch moved forward to contain merges I'm not ready to review and incorporate into my
project.

Hence, an automatic pull would be annoying and can potentially break my train of thought as a work
on my local branch.

What about the case where my local branch contains some commits the remote doesn't have? Does Git
warn me about that and avoid doing the pull?

use one instead of another?
