# Overview

This project is homework for Nanodegree *Front-End Web Developer*, course *Git and GitHub*.

# Concepts Taught and Practiced

Git and GitHub concepts were taught and practiced.

## Git Concepts

* Repository
* Clones
* Commits
* Branches (as labels)
* Merging
* Merge Conflicts
* Remotes
* Tracking Branches (to track remote branches)

Hope I listed them all. Now that I think about it, that course was indeed pretty steep in learning curve. A lot was taught.

## GitHub Concepts

* Forks
* Pull Requests

And also some conventions and *correct ways of using Git and GitHub* to facilitate our efficient collaboration with team members.

## Further Concepts Read

Udacity Nanodegree programs always push us students to read further, and still further.

The above-mentioned concepts already drastically reduced my *planning paralysis* and increased my *experimental and exploratory work speed*.

I read further concepts that allowed me to practically *zero* my *planning paralysis*. Using ``cherry-pick``, ``stash``, ``rebase`` and ``squash``, I was able to rapid-fire my work and commits, and then quickly re-organize my commits into sane structures before ``push``ing my work.

When they said that "*Git is like a big UNDO button*", they didn't mention I could go back and forward in time to do just about corrections I wanted! Marty McFly and Doc Brown (from "*Back To The Future*" movies) would be envious!
